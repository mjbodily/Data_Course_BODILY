# YOUR REMAINING HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT (Fill in with code) ####

# 1.  Get a subset of the "iris" data frame where it's just even-numbered rows

seq(2,150,2) # here's the code to get a list of the even numbers between 2 and 150

row_even <- seq(2,150,2)

iris[row_even, ]


# 2.  Create a new object called iris_chr which is a copy of iris, except where every column is a character class


iris_chr <- as.character(iris[, 1:5])


# 3.  Create a new numeric vector object named "Sepal.Area" which is the product of Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width
Sepal.Length <- iris[,1]
Sepal.Width <- iris[,2]

Sepal.Area <- Sepal.Length*Sepal.Width

# 4.  Add Sepal.Area to the iris data frame as a new column

iris$Sepal.Area <- Sepal.Area

# 5.  Create a new dataframe that is a subset of iris using only rows where Sepal.Area is greater than 20 
      # (name it big_area_iris)

big_area_iris <- iris[Sepal.Area>20,]


# 6.  Upload the last numbered section of this R script (with all answers filled in and tasks completed) 
      # to canvas
      # I should be able to run your R script and get all the right objects generated
